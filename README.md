# Check how LeadAdapter events can reach another workflow

**LinkedIn + your AI assistant · powered by LeadAdapter**

You want another business tool to respond to LeadAdapter events and need to understand the existing webhook registrations before planning that handoff.

**Made for:** Teams connecting business tools

Real tasks need a LeadAdapter account. Connect LinkedIn too when your task needs fresh LinkedIn activity.

## Ask your AI to set this up

Paste this into a coding assistant that can open project files and run commands, such as Codex, Claude Code or Grok Build. You do not need to understand the code first.

```text
Help me use this project: https://github.com/jannikco/linkedin-webhooks-api

I'm not a programmer. My goal is: Check how LeadAdapter events can reach another workflow.

Read the project instructions and set it up in a new folder without overwriting my work.
Guide me through LeadAdapter and its private key setup; never ask me to paste secrets into
this chat. Run a documented sample-data demo if available, then help me get a first small
result from my connected app. Explain the result in plain English. Ask before changing
records, sending messages or publishing anything.
```

## Three useful things to ask for

```text
Show the webhook registrations available to my workspace.
```

```text
Help me plan how an event should be handled by my other tool. Separate an existing
registration from proof that an event was actually delivered.
```

```text
Prepare an event-handoff plan from the registrations we inspected, showing what the
receiving tool still needs to implement.
```

## Your path to a real result

```

1. [Open LeadAdapter setup](https://leadadapter.com/github/start?integration=linkedin-api&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-linkedin-webhooks-api&utm_content=people-first-readme) and sign in or create your account.
2. Connect a LinkedIn profile if your chosen task needs fresh LinkedIn activity.
3. Create the product API key through the official setup, add it privately to your AI project's environment, and ask your AI to try a small read.

**What to expect:** You need one LeadAdapter API key and the workspace access required by the task. LinkedIn operations also depend on the connected profile, consent and available tools. Work that is queued stays pending until a real result is returned.

Add your LeadAdapter key privately in your project settings. Keep keys out of chat and public repositories.

# LinkedIn Workflow Webhooks API — LeadAdapter

**React to lead and sales events without building every workflow around polling.**

Read webhook subscriptions and connect supported LeadAdapter events to your own application. The platform’s webhook API also manages subscriptions, delivery inspection and signing-secret rotation.

[Create your LeadAdapter account](https://leadadapter.com/github/start?integration=linkedin-api&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-linkedin-webhooks-api&utm_content=readme) · [See plans and pricing](https://leadadapter.com/pricing) · [API documentation](https://leadadapter.com/docs/api?lang=en) · [Full API reference](https://leadadapter.com/docs/api-reference?lang=en)

## Built for coding agents

[Download SDKs and the agent kit from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jannikco/linkedin-api/releases/latest).

Use this API from **Claude Code, Codex or Grok Build** in your current coding session. Install the skills into the project where you are building:

```sh
node lib/cli.mjs agents install --client codex --scope project --project /path/to/your/project
# Replace codex with claude or grok for that client.
```

No additional AI model key is needed. Live LinkedIn operations use your **LeadAdapter API key** and connected account permissions. Installation never writes credentials or overwrites conflicting files.

Ask your agent: “Research B2B software founders, produce a shortlist with evidence, and wait for my review before adding anyone to CRM.”

### Run a complete workflow now

```sh
node lib/cli.mjs workflows research-to-crm --fixture
```

Then follow the [research → review → CRM cookbook](docs/research-to-crm.md) for authorized live reads and reviewed CRM handoff. [capabilities.json](capabilities.json) and [llms.txt](llms.txt) provide concise machine-readable discovery. The SDK keeps its raw request API alongside task-level resources. Five runnable task recipes are included in examples/: people research, post engagers, profile enrichment, reviewed CRM handoff and existing CRM sync. Run each without flags for a plan; --fixture uses synthetic receipts. Live mutation recipes require explicit approvals and caller-supplied stable idempotency keys.

## What you can build

- Inspect which LeadAdapter events a workspace already subscribes to.
- Build an event consumer for lead creation, captured comments or approval decisions.
- Inspect delivery attempts and implement a durable, deduplicating receiver.

Built for: Developers building event-driven lead capture, CRM and approval workflows.

## Start with one LeadAdapter API key

Create or sign in to [LeadAdapter](https://leadadapter.com/github/start?integration=linkedin-api&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-linkedin-webhooks-api&utm_content=readme), choose an owned workspace, complete required onboarding, and create a workspace API key under **Settings → API keys**. The only service credential required by this repository is `LEADADAPTER_API_KEY`.

Use a key with `api:read` for these examples. Fresh LinkedIn research needs a connected profile, supported execution access and required consent; your plan’s allowances apply. For a workspace with multiple profiles, add the documented `profile_id` to select one.

### Your first useful API call

Read the existing webhook subscriptions. Creating a subscription and operating a secure event receiver are separate steps described in the API reference.

```sh
export LEADADAPTER_API_KEY="YOUR_WORKSPACE_API_KEY"
```

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "https://leadadapter.com/api/v1/webhooks?page=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LEADADAPTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

The response uses LeadAdapter’s envelope: `ok`, `data`, governance context and request/action identifiers where available. Inspect the actual response; the pinned schema intentionally does not invent a universal lead, profile or search-result shape.

### Use it from JavaScript

Node.js 22+ includes `fetch`; no package installation is needed for this HTTP example:

```js
const response = await fetch("https://leadadapter.com/api/v1/webhooks?page=1", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LEADADAPTER_API_KEY}`,
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
});
const receipt = await response.json();
if (!response.ok || receipt.ok === false) {
  throw new Error(receipt.error?.code ?? `HTTP ${response.status}`);
}
console.log(receipt); // Inspect the returned data or queued-job receipt.
```

## What the full LeadAdapter platform covers

This repository focuses on one API workflow. Your LeadAdapter account also provides the following documented API surfaces; account access, adapter support and operation prerequisites apply.

| Capability | Build this | Documented API routes | Execution considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| People and post discovery | Research prospects and relevant conversations | `POST /linkedin/searches/people`<br>`POST /linkedin/searches/posts` | Fresh retrieval needs a connected, supported executor. |
| Company research | Build account context and inspect known company pages | `POST /linkedin/searches/companies`<br>`GET /linkedin/companies`<br>`POST /linkedin/company-enrichments` | Company-voice operations require the relevant page-admin rights. |
| Profile enrichment | Add visible professional context to selected leads | `POST /linkedin/profile-enrichments` | Allowance, profile-view budget and returned coverage apply; email availability is conditional. |
| Post engagement | Research the people engaging with a selected post | `POST /linkedin/post-engager-requests` | Results depend on what the connected account and adapter can retrieve. |
| Leads and export | Read, qualify and move captured lead data | `GET /leads`<br>`GET /leads/export` | Workspace-scoped data; pagination is explicit. |
| Native CRM | Work with companies, pipelines, stages, deals and tasks | `GET /crm/{entity}`<br>`POST /crm/{entity}`<br>`GET /crm/{entity}/records` | Write scopes and entity-specific inputs apply. |
| Stored content and publishing | Connect editorial review and scheduled publishing | `GET /content-posts`<br>`GET /scheduled-posts`<br>`POST /scheduled-posts` | Queued or scheduled work is distinct from confirmed publication. |
| Messages and connections | Build reviewed conversation and connection workflows | `GET /messages`<br>`POST /linkedin/messages`<br>`POST /linkedin/connection-requests` | Outbound actions remain capped, permissioned and subject to applicable approval. |
| Engagement actions | Prepare relevant comments and reactions | `POST /linkedin/comments`<br>`POST /linkedin/post-reactions` | Writes require the appropriate scope and governance acceptance. |
| Comment-to-lead workflows | Connect a comment keyword to a controlled follow-up process | `GET /automations`<br>`POST /automations` | Supported triggers are comment_keyword and any_comment; DM prerequisites and limits apply. |
| Lead pages and tracked links | Connect campaigns with lead capture and tracked assets | `GET /lead-pages`<br>`GET /links` | Publication and asset management are separate governed operations. |
| Approvals and audit | Review proposed actions and understand execution decisions | `GET /approvals`<br>`POST /approvals/{approval_id}/decisions`<br>`GET /actions` | Approval does not override caps or unavailable capabilities. |
| Webhooks | React to supported lead, comment, message and approval events | `GET /webhooks`<br>`POST /webhooks`<br>`GET /webhooks/{id}/deliveries` | Configure subscriptions and validate signed deliveries in your receiver. |
| Sales intelligence | Connect research with business context and reviewable opportunities | `GET /signals`<br>`GET /sales-opportunities`<br>`GET /business-context` | Availability follows the account’s configured features and existing records. |

## Operations highlighted in this repository

| Operation ID | HTTP route, relative to `/api/v1` | Required scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@webhooks_list_get` | `GET /webhooks` | `api:read` |

This is a focused API recipe, currently maintained as an example. It uses existing LeadAdapter endpoints; it does not add a separate LinkedIn backend. Use the [API reference](https://leadadapter.com/docs/api-reference?lang=en) for complete inputs, limits and operation behavior.

## Fresh data, queued jobs and reliable outcomes

Stored workspace data can return immediately. Fresh LinkedIn retrieval or outbound work may return a job receipt, including `job_id`, instead of a completed result. When a job is returned:

1. Keep its identifier and the request’s idempotency key.
2. Poll `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}` with the same workspace key. A documented `wait=true` can hold the read for up to25 seconds.
3. Inspect the terminal status and result/error: `done`, `failed` or `cancelled`. `queued` and `leased` are still in progress.

```sh
export JOB_ID="REPLACE_WITH_RETURNED_JOB_ID"
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  "https://leadadapter.com/api/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID?wait=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LEADADAPTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

An accepted request, an approved action and confirmed LinkedIn delivery are separate states. Do not report successful delivery from a queue acknowledgement.

## Permissions and operational control

- **One workspace key, explicit scopes.** Use `api:read` for the documented reads, and grant write access only for the operations your application needs. Store keys server-side; do not place them in browser bundles, commits or issue reports.
- **Connected-account execution.** Browser-mode work uses the user’s connected browser. Supported consented cloud operations can run independently of Chrome. Availability is checked per operation; an API route does not grant unrestricted LinkedIn access.
- **Governed actions.** Workspace/profile caps, pacing, do-not-engage rules, account permissions and required approvals still apply. Some operations support `dry_run`; check the operation’s schema before sending it.
- **Explicit retries.** Operations requiring `Idempotency-Key` include fresh-data POST reads as well as writes. Reuse the same key and payload for the same logical request. Resolve uncertain outcomes before issuing a new request.
- **Useful errors.** Handle permission/capability refusals, validation errors and429 pacing responses. Preserve request identifiers for support and follow any returned retry guidance.

## Public client, private service

This repository publishes a runnable API recipe under MIT. LeadAdapter’s hosted application, connected-account execution, governance, data storage and commercial service remain private. The public code does not include the service backend or a self-hosted substitute for a LeadAdapter account. This is an independent LeadAdapter integration, not an official LinkedIn API or LinkedIn-endorsed SDK.

## Verification and support

This code is checked with contract fixtures; the MCP artifact also tests stdio tools/call. These checks establish client behavior, not live LinkedIn provider execution or conversion outcomes. See `integration.json` and `SHA256SUMS` for the recorded artifact evidence. The source contract is [LeadAdapter’s public OpenAPI](https://leadadapter.com/api/v1/openapi.json).

For a reproducible client bug, open a repository issue with the operation ID and a sanitized request identifier. For account access, plans or execution availability, use LeadAdapter’s in-app support. Never include API keys, personal lead data or session material.
