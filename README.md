# LeadAdapter webhook inspector

Inspect webhook registrations using the documented API.

Maintainer: jannikco · License: MIT · Verification: **mock-only**

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm start
```

The default example runs locally without credentials and makes no external changes. Verification status describes recorded evidence; local configuration tests do not establish that provider authentication or execution works.

## Authorized execution

Selected operation IDs: @webhooks_list_get. Review integration.json and lib/operations.js for exact paths, scopes and parameters. Set LEADADAPTER_API_KEY and optionally LEADADAPTER_PARAMS (JSON with path, query or body), then run npm start -- --live. The example only executes operations classified api:read, including LinkedIn POST read requests. POST reads require an explicit idempotencyKey in LEADADAPTER_PARAMS. Replace example identifiers with authorized account data before live execution. Pending jobs, approvals and capability availability depend on your workspace and connected account.

## Example request parameters

The following is illustrative input for the first selected operation. Replace example identifiers with data you are authorized to use and choose a unique idempotency key per new request. The default example does not send this request.

```json
{}
```

Set LEADADAPTER_PARAMS to your edited JSON when explicitly running --live. Keep the same idempotency key only when retrying the same logical request.
